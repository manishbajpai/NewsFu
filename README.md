News reporting: The way it should be

## What is it about?
The news websites are often too busy looking, designed in a way to invite clickbaiting, ragebaiting etc. While some of the entries cover news, there are others which are far removed from actual news content and remain on the front page for a long time to attract user engagement. 
This project envisions a simplified user interface that focuses on showing the news headlines from multiple sources you care about. We understand that people have different preferences about how they want to see the news and so we aim to provide customizations of look and feel per your taste.

## Development
The development of this project is divided into two parts - update the database, and present the news. These two items are tied together via the uniform database schema shared between all news sources.

### Update the database
In order to add a new source to the database, you need to create a script that fetches the said data and puts in a database. The script can be in any language you like. We are using python for now.

### Present the news
This means fetching the links from the database and presenting them to the user based on their prefereces. This needs to be in python.
